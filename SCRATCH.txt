- a constant roll_die with a default 6 value -- DONE
	- replace existing roll_die in Match -- DONE
- create method punch in Fighter class -- DONE
	- uses roll_die const, using total rank (eg 10) and if >= self rank -- DONE
	- returns true or false -- DONE
- create player class -- DONE
	- initialize with target -- DONE
	- inherit from Fighter class -- DONE
	- override punch method -- DONE
		- do target stuff and return true/false -- DONE
- rewrite run_punch_encounter -- DONE
	- remove target from match
	- run fighter.punch instead of target.punch
	- return fighter if fighter.punch is true other return nothing
- rename Match to Round
- create a Match class that initialses with Round
	-	Match calls round.something_happens?
	- Match calls round.encounter
	- if round.encounter returns a fighter, add fighter to Match score
- test at the end


TODO:
- in a match, when punch is true for opponent, they always hit:
	- maybe they should only be successful a set number of times, depending on rank (KISS)
- grudge: another attribute that randomlt develops after a fight. The next trash talk will take this attribute into account
 - maybe we offer a player a faux choice - how they respond to a fighter post-fight always results in a grudge, but chooses the flavor of grudge (disrespect/something comes out about the coach/pandering to fans)
 - stuff to lookup for trash talk and highlights
	- age
	- no_of_fights
	- last_fight_result
	- last_fight_MO
	- streak
